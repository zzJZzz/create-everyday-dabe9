**I love to create and to problem solve.** The silver power ranger? That was my idea. I'm not saying they stole my crayon drawing, but I haven't been able to find them anywhere.

I have been **daydreaming** and **inventing** since I was a baby. My 1st words were "I got an idea, daddy-o". I'm not sure why they let me listen to Jazz at such a young age.

> Software, board games, physical products, jokes, maybe a baby.

I love that we can create something and make an impact. To have an **idea** or a **thought** in the morning and have a version of it by the evening. Then it's on the internet, a legacy (hopefully) forever.

I want to **create everyday.** 

Sincerely,

JZ
