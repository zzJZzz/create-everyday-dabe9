          JZ is a wonderful partner to work with. His insights are invaluable,
          and whenever I need help looking a project from a new point of view,
          he always brings a fresh eye and new ideas. I know whenever I need
          help, he'll be ready to assist.

          Known him his whole life. I've never seen anyone so obsessive when it
          comes to problem solving. (I'm worried he may invent a time machine
          and mess with the time continuum).
